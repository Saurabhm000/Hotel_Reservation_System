# Hotel_Reservation_System
This is a console-based Hotel Reservation System developed in Java using MySQL for backend data storage. It allows hotel staff to perform basic reservation operations like adding new guests, viewing bookings, updating guest information, and deleting reservations. 

**üìò About the Project**

This Hotel Reservation System simplifies the booking process by enabling the hotel management to:
	‚Ä¢	Create new room reservations.
	‚Ä¢	View all current reservations.
	‚Ä¢	Search for a guest‚Äôs room number.
	‚Ä¢	Update existing reservation details.
	‚Ä¢	Delete bookings when no longer needed.

The system checks for room availability before making a new booking, ensuring no duplicate room reservations. It operates through a menu-driven command-line interface and stores all data in a MySQL table named reservations.
